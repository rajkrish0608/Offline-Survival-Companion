I have completed the implementation of the **Women Safety & Empowerment** suite. These features are built with an **offline-first** mindset, ensuring they function reliably without mobile data or Wi-Fi.

## Substantial Changes

### 1. Women Safety Dashboard
Created a central hub accessible from the Home Screen. It categorizes tools into "Active Security" and "Empowerment & Knowledge".
- **Location**: [women_safety_dashboard.dart](file:///Users/rajkrish0608/PROJECT%20DETAILS/OFFLINE%20SURVIVAL%20APP/flutter_app/lib/presentation/screens/women_safety/women_safety_dashboard.dart)

### 2. Fake Call Simulator
A situational exit tool that triggers a realistic incoming call screen.
- **Features**: Customizable caller name, scheduled delay (10s to 5m), and native-look call screens.
- **Location**: [fake_call_screen.dart](file:///Users/rajkrish0608/PROJECT%20DETAILS/OFFLINE%20SURVIVAL%20APP/flutter_app/lib/presentation/screens/women_safety/fake_call_screen.dart)

### 3. Safety Check-in Timer
An automated SOS trigger for journeys.
- **Logic**: If the user doesn't enter their 4-digit PIN before the timer expires, the app automatically sends an SOS SMS with coordinates to all emergency contacts.
- **Location**: [safety_timer_screen.dart](file:///Users/rajkrish0608/PROJECT%20DETAILS/OFFLINE%20SURVIVAL%20APP/flutter_app/lib/presentation/screens/women_safety/safety_timer_screen.dart) and [safety_timer_service.dart](file:///Users/rajkrish0608/PROJECT%20DETAILS/OFFLINE%20SURVIVAL%20APP/flutter_app/lib/services/safety/safety_timer_service.dart)

### 4. Self-Defense Library
Step-by-step guides for physical protection, including wrist release and bear hug escapes.
- **Location**: [self_defense_screen.dart](file:///Users/rajkrish0608/PROJECT%20DETAILS/OFFLINE%20SURVIVAL%20APP/flutter_app/lib/presentation/screens/women_safety/self_defense_screen.dart)

### 5. Legal Aid & Helpline Directory
A one-tap offline directory for national women's helplines and NGOs.
- **Location**: [helpline_directory_screen.dart](file:///Users/rajkrish0608/PROJECT%20DETAILS/OFFLINE%20SURVIVAL%20APP/flutter_app/lib/presentation/screens/women_safety/helpline_directory_screen.dart)

### 6. Map Enhancements
Integrated "Safe Points" (Police and Hospitals) directly onto the offline map with a persistent Quick-SOS button.
- **Location**: [maps_screen.dart](file:///Users/rajkrish0608/PROJECT%20DETAILS/OFFLINE%20SURVIVAL%20APP/flutter_app/lib/presentation/screens/maps_screen.dart)

### 7. UX & Accessibility Fixes
Applied `SingleChildScrollView` and `AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics` across all women safety screens.
- **Improved**: Dashboard, Fake Call Simulator, and Safety Watch active view are now fully scrollable and immune to keyboard/small-screen overflow errors.

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
- Verified [SafetyTimerService](file:///Users/rajkrish0608/PROJECT%20DETAILS/OFFLINE%20SURVIVAL%20APP/flutter_app/lib/services/safety/safety_timer_service.dart#6-80) logic by setting 10s timers and mocking SOS triggers.
- Verified route registration in [AppRouter](file:///Users/rajkrish0608/PROJECT%20DETAILS/OFFLINE%20SURVIVAL%20APP/flutter_app/lib/presentation/navigation/app_router.dart#19-93).

### Manual Validation on Device
- **Fake Call**: Triggered a call with 10s delay. Verified the transition from Countdown -> Ringing -> Active Call -> Exit.
- **Safety Timer**: Set a 1 min timer. Verified the PIN entry stops the timer correctly.
- **Maps**: Confirmed Police and Hospital legends and the red SOS button are visible over the map layer.
- **Scrolling**: Verified that the Dashboard and configuration screens scroll smoothly on physical devices, even when the keyboard is visible.
