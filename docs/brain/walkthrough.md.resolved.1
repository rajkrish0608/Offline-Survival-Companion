# Walkthrough: Running the Application

I have successfully launched the Offline Survival Companion application.

## Steps Taken

1.  **Environment Check**: Identified available emulators and connected devices.
2.  **Troubleshooting**: Attempted to launch Android emulators, but both failed to start automatically.
3.  **Dependency Management**: Updated project dependencies using `flutter pub get`.
4.  **Platform Verification**: Successfully built and ran the application on **macOS desktop**.
5.  **Multi-Platform Launch**: Launched the **iOS Simulator** (iPhone 17 Pro) and successfully ran the application.

## Verification Results

- **Build Status**: macOS & iOS applications built successfully.
- **Initialization**: Sync engine initialized correctly on both platforms.
- **Runtime**: Applications are interactive and running in debug mode.

> [!NOTE]
> The application is now running on both your **macOS desktop** and the **iOS Simulator**. You should see the iPhone 17 Pro window active on your screen.


## Next Steps
- If you still need to run it on Android, please manually start your emulator or connect a physical device, and I can run it there for you.
