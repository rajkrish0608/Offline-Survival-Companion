# Walkthrough: Running the Application

I have successfully launched the Offline Survival Companion application.

## Steps Taken

1.  **Environment Check**: Identified available emulators and connected devices.
2.  **Troubleshooting**: Attempted to launch Pixel 8 and Pixel API 36 emulators, but both failed to start automatically.
3.  **Dependency Management**: Updated project dependencies using `flutter pub get`.
4.  **Platform Switch**: Switched the target to macOS desktop to bypass emulator issues.
5.  **Build and Launch**: Successfully built and ran the application on macOS.

## Verification Results

- **Build Status**: macOS application built successfully.
- **Initialization**: Sync engine initialized correctly.
- **Runtime**: Application is interactive and running in debug mode.

> [!NOTE]
> The application is currently running on your macOS desktop. You should see the app window active on your screen.

## Next Steps
- If you still need to run it on Android, please manually start your emulator or connect a physical device, and I can run it there for you.
